I purchased a house on 7539 Arthur Street on Dec. 2008
since then have had branches fallen down on my vehicle (parked on the street) in front of my house, due to the overgrown branches
The City advised that they did not have the funds available to prune/trim the tree (few years ago) which I had to pay myself because of the damages caused to my vehicles. Which was classified as an act of nature by the City. Yet I see other trees being planted in Oakland!! Don't understand how this is possible if they can't keep up with the ones already planted in dire need of trimming. Last nights wind caused a few branches to break off, the tree overhangs above my house and electrical cables...the problem with overgrown trees on Arthur Street (73rd to 78th Ave) must be resolved...They attract illegal dumping, reduce lighting and attract illegal activities."
