These trees were installed barely over a year ago by an outside contractor.  The root ball was obviously not placed deep enough and the trees weren't adequately staked.  What was a beautiful to the streetscape is now an eyesore and potentially hazardous.  Please note that I'm filing a separate complaint about a tree around the corner that was damaged under similar circumstances. ,2013-10-30T18:48:02-04:00,https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0016/0827/tia1145718314.jpg,"downed, broken tree",2013-10-25T16:35:45-04:00,https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0016/5993/Tree_Akimbo.jpg,This is one of about 10 street trees that were planted just over a year ago as part of the Lakeshore Complete Streets Improvement Project.  Three have already fallen and been removed.  At least three others have snapped off part way up the trunk including one on Rand that's two-thirds gone.  This can't be coincidental.  Blame has to go to the contractors who installed the trees without adequate staking and most likely too shallow with too little soil compaction.  The trees need to be replaced.  It would be nice to see it done at the contractor's expense - not the city's. ,2013-12-01T18:09:07-05:00,06/10/2014 10:50:16 PM,37.8089899,-122.24765689

I purchased a house on 7539 Arthur Street on Dec. 2008
since then have had branches fallen down on my vehicle (parked on the street) in front of my house, due to the overgrown branches
The City advised that they did not have the funds available to prune/trim the tree (few years ago) which I had to pay myself because of the damages caused to my vehicles. Which was classified as an act of nature by the City. Yet I see other trees being planted in Oakland!! Don't understand how this is possible if they can't keep up with the ones already planted in dire need of trimming.
